/* we chose circle as the shape for the clip-path (we can also use rect(x="" y="" width="" height="") for a rectangle/square clipping). 
The First parameter for the circle clipping determines how big the circle clip should be. The second parameter determines the positioning on the x axis (horizontal axis) while the third parameter determines the positioning on the y axis (verticle axis). */

/* The polygon function allows you to specify your own specific shape. A cool website to use to help you generate the shape is: https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/ This will allow you to quickly create a shape without worrying about the calculations and parameters required to make the desired shape.

In the Polygon each pair value makes up the point so the first point of 0% 0% will tart at the top left. The first number relates the the x (horizontal) axis while the second number relates to the y (verticle) axis. 

The remainder image-clips uses the polygon clip to create the following shapes.*/
